# Etch-a-Sketch

!(./Images/main_app.jpg)

This etch-a-sketch is a browser-based drawing app in which the user is able to draw pretty pictures. It is named "Etch-a-Sketch" because, although it doesn't have the classic red etch-a-sketch design, the user uses their mouse to draw, meaning they must begin from the edge each time (just like with a real etch-a-sketch). 

This app features various drawing modes as well as the ability to change the grid (drawing pixel) size.
