# Etch-a-Sketch

![](./Images/main_app.png)

This etch-a-sketch is a browser-based drawing app in which the user is able to draw pretty pictures. It is named "Etch-a-Sketch" because, although it doesn't have the classic red etch-a-sketch design, the user uses their mouse to draw, meaning they must begin from the edge each time (just like with a real etch-a-sketch). 

This app features various drawing modes as well as the ability to change the grid (drawing pixel) size.

The party mode is a fun mode in which the colors are randomly generated.

#### Shading Mode

![](./Images/shading_mode.png)

"Shading" is a mode in which the color goes from white to black, one shade at a time, as the mouse goes over the pixel.

#### Eraser Mode

A mode in which the "color" is white, so going over previous work "erases" it.

#### Clear Grid

Select this to clear the grid, erasing all of your work.
